This is a very short story about a puppy named Isabel. She was afraid of everything and hated going outside. This made going on walks difficult. And then she never went on a walk again. 

But one day, Isabel was looking out the window and saw another dog on a walk. So she brainstormed ways to get outside.

Isabel waited for the day that mom or dad left the door open. She planned to take herself for a walk!

Lastly, the day came that Isabel saw the door was left open. She ran through the open door! She hated the outdoors and ran back inside to safety.
